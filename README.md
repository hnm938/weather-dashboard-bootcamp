GitHub Pages: https://hnm938.github.io/weather-dashboard-bootcamp/

This project is for the UofT bootcamp module 6, We were tasked to create a 
simple 5 day forecast weather dashboard using the OpenWeather API.

Users can search the weather anywhere on the globe by city name, their
current location's weather is displayed and their search history
is stored using local storage.
